            <p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaVBDPAy-SI" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaVBDPAy-SI', 'interview']);" target="_blank">interview</a>, Neil deGrasse Tyson talks about science
              boosting the economy. He goes on to say, most companies and politicians don’t have the tolerance for the long term view.</p>
            <p>You don’t motivate a group of kids, saying “Who wants to be a mechanical engineer and help improve flight efficiency by 15% compared to the airplane your father flew?”</p>
            <p>But instead, ask “Who wants to be an engineer and help develop airfoils to help fly in the atmosphere of Mars?” With the latter, you get the best students in the class.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Flow is the intersection of what you are good at and what challenges you— where difficulty and competency meet.</p>
              <p>When your competency exceeds the difficulty of a task, you are bored. And when the difficulty exceeds your competency, you are anxious. That was my problem: I was bored.</p>

            <p>There are times where the day job requires me to do the mundane. That’s fine. We can’t always have constant excitement. It’s called work for a reason.</p>
            <p><h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>For inspiration, this is one of the reasons that I have side projects. To keep pushing my limits. It allows me to play. To find out how to make user interfaces for VR, tinker with implementing the <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.ampproject.org/', 'Acelerated Mobile Pages Project']);" target="_blank">Acelerated Mobile Pages Project</a> on content, create a <a href="http://garybacon.com/snapchat/" target="_blank">landing page for Snapchat</a>, write books, and so much more.</p>
